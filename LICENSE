# AutoHired — Development Guide

This document describes how to work on AutoHired locally and how the project
is structured.

This guide is for development, evaluation, and contribution only.

## Scope & Intent

AutoHired is being developed as a hosted product.
This repository exists to support development and collaboration — not
third-party SaaS deployment.

See `LICENSE` for binding terms.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- Vite (frontend)
- Node.js (backend)
- Drizzle ORM (database)

## Repository Structure

/
├─ src/                  Frontend application
├─ packages/
│  ├─ server/             Backend server
│  ├─ core/               Shared logic & types
│  └─ *-client/           Client variants (if applicable)
├─ drizzle/               Database schema & migrations
├─ .env.example
├─ README.md
├─ DEVELOPMENT.md

## Local Development

Requirements:
- Node.js 18+
- npm

Setup:

1. cp .env.example .env
2. npm install
3. npm run dev

The application runs locally in development mode only.

## Common Scripts

- npm run dev        Start dev environment
- npm run build      Local production build
- npm run start      Run built app locally
- npm run check      TypeScript checks
- npm run db:push    Push schema via drizzle-kit

## Development Conventions

- Prefer explicit, readable code over clever abstractions
- Type boundaries matter — be clear at module edges
- If behavior is non-obvious, document it

## Final Note

If something feels under-documented, it probably is.
Improving clarity is a valid contribution.
